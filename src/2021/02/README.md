# Day 2

`puzzle.js`: Only one version for today. It was easier than yesterday ðŸ¤”.

To test (from project root):

```
yarn test 2021/01
```

Today I read the README.md again and...

Solve without sending to AOC:
```
yarn solve 0 *day*
```

Solve sending part_1:
```
yarn solve 1 *day*
```

Solve sending part_2:
```
yarn solve 2 *day*
```

So no need to make tests in test with the real input. I'll delete them now. Still, I may be use it in a future again because the test measures execution time.
